This is a class project of COEN 280 at Santa Clara University. 
In this project, I created a database to hold more than 1 million entries from Yelp sample dataset.

createdb.sql-------  create database schema
dropdb.sql-------    drop database and all the information
Populate.java is used to parse json file and populate the date base with the parsed information
hw3.java is the GUI for querying the database.
The GUI contains filters for the business and users. The filter can be used to select different categories of business and select them based on the reviews.
The users can be filterd by years of membership, review number, etc.
